                <p>Osteopathy is a holistic whole-body approach that is adapted to each person at each visit.

                <h2>Origin of Osteopathic Medicine</h2>
                <p>
                Osteopathy, also known as Osteopathic Medicine, was founded by the renowned American physician, Dr. Andrew Taylor Still, who put forth a series of principles which Osteopaths are still guided by today. <span className="emphasis secondary">Osteopathic principles treat the body as a complete and harmonious unit (mind, body, and spirit)</span>. This understanding supports the interrelated systems of structure (Anatomy) and function (Physiology) which assists the body in self-regulating and self-healing.
                </p>
                <p>
                Osteopaths are highly trained in Anatomy, Bio-Mechanics and Physiology and work with the natural motions of all parts of the body. All of our joints and muscles move in a certain way, and breath creates movement throughout the body which massages the organs while the heart pumps blood creating motion in the tissues.
                </p>
                <p>
                <span className="emphasis secondary">All parts and processes in our beautiful body continuously move and work together perfectly.</span>
